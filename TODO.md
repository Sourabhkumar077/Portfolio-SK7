# TODO: Change Website Fonts to Creative Fonts

## Steps to Complete

- [ ] Update `src/app/globals.css` to import "BBH Sans Bartle" from Google Fonts and define a custom CSS class `.bbh-sans-bartle-regular` for the font.
- [ ] Update `src/app/page.tsx` to apply the `.bbh-sans-bartle-regular` class to the hero section text ("A FULL-STACK DEVELOPER" and "PRODUCT DESIGNER").
- [ ] Optionally apply the font class to key headings like "What I Do" and "Tech Stack" where it enhances the creative look.
- [ ] Run the development server to verify the font loads and renders correctly.
- [ ] Test readability and visual appeal on different screen sizes; adjust if needed.
